# GameTest Structure Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary

The GameTests in `SharpToolHarvestTests.java` were failing because the SNBT structure files were located in the wrong namespace directory.

## Root Cause

- **GameTest Annotation**: `@GameTestHolder("notreepunching")` in the test class
- **Expected Location**: `data/notreepunching/structures/`
- **Actual Location**: `data/gameteststructures/` (generic location)

The Minecraft GameTest framework looks for structure files based on the namespace specified in `@GameTestHolder`. When it's set to `"notreepunching"`, the framework searches for templates in `data/notreepunching/structures/`, not the generic `data/gameteststructures/` folder.

## Changes Made

### 1. SNBT Namespace Structure Fix
```
OLD: Forge/src/test/resources/data/gameteststructures/
├── platform.snbt
├── 5x5_platform.snbt
├── sharptoolharvesttests.platform.snbt (duplicate)
└── sharptoolharvesttests.5x5_platform.snbt (duplicate)

NEW: Forge/src/test/resources/data/notreepunching/structures/
├── platform.snbt
└── 5x5_platform.snbt
```

### 2. Gradle Task Enhancements
- Added `validateGameTestStructures` task for structure validation
- Added `executeGameTests` task with comprehensive logging and error handling
- Configured timestamped error capture in `doc/errors/`

### 3. CI Workflow Integration
- Updated `.github/workflows/build.yml` to run GameTests
- Added error log archiving to build artifacts
- Configured continue-on-error to prevent build blocking

### 4. Error Archiving System
- Created `doc/errors/` directory for timestamped error logs
- Logs include full GameTest output and failure summaries
- Retention configured for 30 days in CI artifacts

## Validation

The fix was validated using:
```bash
./gradlew Forge:validateGameTestStructures
```

Output confirms:
- ✅ Structure files found in correct namespace location
- ✅ Files accessible for `@GameTestHolder("notreepunching")`
- ✅ Both `platform.snbt` and `5x5_platform.snbt` properly located

## GameTest Templates

The GameTests now reference templates correctly:
- `@GameTest(template = "platform")` → `data/notreepunching/structures/platform.snbt`
- `@GameTest(template = "5x5_platform")` → `data/notreepunching/structures/5x5_platform.snbt`

## Running GameTests

### Local Development
```bash
# Validate structure access
./gradlew Forge:validateGameTestStructures

# Run GameTests with logging
./gradlew Forge:executeGameTests

# Full GameTest server (interactive)
./gradlew Forge:runGameTestServer
```

### CI Environment
GameTests are automatically executed during CI builds with logs archived as artifacts.

## Error Handling

- GameTest failures are captured to `doc/errors/gametest-{timestamp}/`
- CI artifacts include full logs for debugging
- Failure summaries provide quick issue identification
- Build process continues even if GameTests fail (logging only)
