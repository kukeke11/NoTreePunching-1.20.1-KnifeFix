This is a Minecraft mod meant to add a little more believability to your first few minutes of Minecraft play. It was initially inspired by features from TerraFirmaCraft, but has since been refocused around the titular idea:

**Blocks don't drop anything if broken with the incorrect tool.**

In order to cope with this, there are several new features:

- [Rocks](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/WorldGeneration) are found on the ground and can be picked up without a tool.
- Leaves can be harvested without a tool for sticks (this is a vanilla feature, but will be very important here).
- Gravel can be mined without a tool, and enables you to acquire flint.
- Flint can be [knapped](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Knapping) on an exposed stone surface, obtaining flint shards.
- A [flint knife](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/FlintTools) can now be crafted, allowing you to harvest plant materials for plant fibers and craft plant string.
- A [flint axe](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/FlintTools) can enable you to collect wood and build a crafting table.
- A [flint pickaxe, hoe, shovel](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/FlintTools) will serve as early game tools, while you can create a [macuahuitl](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/FlintTools) for a good early game weapon.

Later on in the game, there are also a couple other additions and changes which fit the stylistic theme of this mod:

- Vanilla recipes for wooden and stone tools have been removed.
- The vanilla campfire recipe has been removed, and instead can be created by using a [fire starter](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/FireStarter).
- [Pottery](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Pottery) can be created using a clay tool on a block of clay, forming it to shape before firing it in a campfire or a furnace.
- [Knives](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Knives) are a new tool available in all vanilla tool materials, and can be used as weak swords, as a crafting tool, or a plant harvester.
- [Saws](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Saws) are weaker axes which can be used as crafting items, and are essential for converting wood into planks and planks into sticks.
- [Mattocks](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/no-tree-punching/wiki/Mattocks) are the ultimate all-in-one tool. They can mine blocks as if they were a shovel or axe, can strip wood like an axe, till grass like a hoe, and make paths like a shovel. (The latter two functions sometimes conflict and can be chosen by sneaking)

I hope you enjoy :)
